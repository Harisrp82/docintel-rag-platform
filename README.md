# DocIntel RAG Platform

**Production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform for document intelligence, semantic search, and source-aware question answering.**

This repository contains a full-stack RAG application that enables searching, retrieving, and generating answers from document collections using embedding-based retrieval and generative language models. The platform is designed to support real-world workflows where users want to interact with documents in a conversational manner and extract precise, context-aware answers from their data.

## 🧠 Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of vector-based semantic search with large language models (LLMs) to provide responses grounded in the content of your documents. This approach ensures that generated answers are contextually relevant and based on up-to-date source material, rather than only on the training data of the LLM. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This platform is ideal for:

- Document question answering  
- Knowledge base search  
- Document intelligence and analytics  
- Semantic search across unstructured corpora
